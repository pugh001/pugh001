- 👋 Hi, It seems I’m @DIT15 here!
     How I came up that name I have no idea, was probably going to be my password and got switched with my real name, which is Jason Pugh unless I remember what ditis means, don't think it was "Defense Instructional Technology Information System"
- 👀 I’m (sometimes) interested in coding, have a mixed bag of experience from starting in BASIC to now playing with whatever attracts my eye.
     Most languages follow enough of a similar pattern so always willing to give it a go.
     Worked on in no particular order: BASIC, C, Powershell, Java, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Dataflex, DBase, Clipper, SQL, Informix 4GL, J2EE, Ruby, Javascript, Python and  probably many more...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (again) and Python (a repo with a trading bot might appear if it works and makes money)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me!
- 📫 How to reach me ... https://www.linkedin.com/in/pugh001/ probably a good start.

Coming soon: (As this is new) Will start adding some little projects...
